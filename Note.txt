=====================================================

The order css is going to look at putting style:
1. Origin and Important
2. Specificity
3. Order of Appearance.

That is why:
    <div class="red blue">xxxx</div>
    <div class="blue red">yyy</div>

.red {
  color: red;
}
.blue {
  color: blue;
}

Both show blue.
Because of rule 3. Order of Appearance.

------------------

The order of origin  + !important:
1. important user declarations
2. important author declarations
3. Animation
4. Transitions
5. Author declarations
6. User declarations
7. User agent declarations


------------------

This is a great solution to put thing at the right bottom corner
margin-left: auto => would work outside of a grid or flex
margin-top: auto => will have no impact.
  margin-top: auto;
  margin-left: auto;

or:
  align-self: end;
  justify-self: end;
